tBodyAcc-mean()-X       Mean Total Body Acceleration in X direction                         quantitative
tBodyAcc-mean()-Y       Mean Total Body Acceleration in Y direction                         quantitative
tBodyAcc-mean()-Z       Mean Total Body Acceleration in Z direction                          quantitative

tBodyAcc-std()-X            Std Deviation for Total Body Acceleration in X direction     quantitative
tBodyAcc-std()-Y            Std Deviation for Total Body Acceleration in Y direction     quantitative
tBodyAcc-std()-Z            Std Deviation for Total Body Acceleration in Z direction      quantitative

Note:
All quantitative variables have been Normalized to [-1, 1]

The data sets listed in TidyData.txt and TidyData2.txt provide the following summary statistics.
The first table lists mean values of the tBodyAcc-mean()-X/Y/Z variables for each Subject.
The second table lists mean values of the tBodyAcc-mean()-X/Y/Z variables by Activity.
The third table lists mean values of the tBodyAcc-std()-X/Y/Z variables for each Subject.
The fourth table lists mean values of the tBodyAcc-std()-X/Y/Z variables by Activity.
